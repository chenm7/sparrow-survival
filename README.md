# Summary

After a severe storm hit Rhode Island in 1898, 136 house sparrows were collected and had their physical traits recorded. 64 of the sparrows ended up perishing while the remaining 72 survived. In this project (collaboration with Douglas Turner), we built a logistic regression model with survival as the response and various physical characteristics as predictors.
